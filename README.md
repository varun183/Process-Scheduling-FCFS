# Process-Scheduling-FCFS



#This Java project implements the First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm, which is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that schedules processes in the order they arrive . The project features a graphical user interface  that displays the progress of each process as they are being scheduled, allowing the user to visualize how the FCFS algorithm works.
